# Student Attendance Tracker

## Project Overview
The **Student Attendance Tracker** is a web-based application designed to help educational institutions manage and track student attendance in real-time. This system allows instructors to generate QR codes tied to specific class sessions and modules. Students can then scan these codes to mark their attendance. The system ensures efficient, accurate, and automated attendance recording and management.

## Key Features

1. **Student Registration and Login**
   - Students can register and log in securely with their credentials.
   - Authentication features include login, registration, and password recovery, powered by Laravel's built-in authentication system.

2. **QR Code Generation for Classes**
   - Instructors can generate unique QR codes for specific class sessions.
   - QR codes are associated with session details, such as the module, the date of the session, and the specific class time.
   - Students can scan these QR codes using their smartphones or computers to mark their attendance.

3. **Attendance Tracking**
   - The system records when students mark their attendance through scanning the QR code.
   - Attendance is logged with session-specific data, ensuring accuracy.
   - An attendance report is generated for each student and can be reviewed by both students and instructors.

4. **Admin and Instructor Roles**
   - Instructors and admins have different access levels to manage sessions, generate QR codes, and view attendance data.
   - Admins can manage user accounts and oversee attendance data for all sessions.

5. **Real-Time Data Storage**
   - All attendance data is securely stored in a **PostgreSQL** database, allowing for efficient query and retrieval.
   - Students' attendance is tracked over time, enabling detailed reports on attendance patterns, trends, and anomalies.

6. **Module and Session Management**
   - Instructors can create and manage different academic modules or sessions that they are teaching.
   - Students can view their enrollment in modules and attend corresponding sessions.

7. **Reports and Analytics**
   - Generate detailed reports that can display attendance statistics, trends, and historical data.
   - Both students and instructors can track attendance over time, enabling insights into student participation.

8. **Responsive User Interface**
   - The application has a clean and modern interface, ensuring ease of use for both students and instructors.
   - The user interface is responsive, ensuring it works well across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

   - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
   - Blade templating engine (Laravel)
   - Bootstrap for UI components (optional)

- **Backend**:  
   - **Laravel** (PHP framework)
   - Authentication via Laravelâ€™s built-in auth scaffolding
   - QR code generation libraries (e.g., `SimpleQrcode` for Laravel)
   - Database: **PostgreSQL** (or MySQL, depending on your preference)

- **Version Control**:  
   - **Git** for version control
   - Hosted on **GitHub** or another version control platform

## Target Audience
This application is primarily designed for educational institutions, including:
- Schools and universities that require a streamlined attendance tracking system.
- Instructors who need an automated and easy-to-use tool to track student attendance.
